# User Registration in Angular 5 With Web API and ASP.NET Identity
This is an Angular 5 Application to demonstrate implementation of User Registration / Sign Up Form With ASP.NET Identity  

###### Before Running this Project
 1. Install npm packages using 'npm install' command.
 2. Change Web API DB Connection String
 3. Execute the DB scripts on an SQL server instance
 
######Further improvements to the test would be

* have the website authenticate using OAuth (in the project I only used user authorisation via OAuth)
* have a separate database (or at least a different db schema) to hold the application logs and the data audits
* better front end
* include another password text field where users would confirm their password prior to registration
* created an event log to log unhandled exceptions
